# High-Blood-Pressure-Predictor-Machine Learning

Performed machine learning analysis to predict whether a smoker will have high blood pressure or not. 

Data munging and Feature Engineering concepts were used to clean the training and test data. 

Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector machines to predict the outcome of test dataset
